          Write the greetUser() function that prompts the user
          for his/her gender and last name and stores the results
          in variables.

          For gender:
          	If the user enters a gender other than "Male" or "Female",
          	prompt him/her to try again.

          For last name:
          	If the user leaves the last name blank, prompt him/her to
          	try again.
          	If the user enters a number for the last name, tell the user
          	that a last name can't be a number and prompt him/her to try again.

          After collecting the gender and last name...
          	If the gender is valid, pop up an alert that
          	greets the user appropriately (e.g, "Hello Ms. Smith!")
          	If the gender is not valid, pop up an alert
          	that reads something like "XYZ is not a gender!"
