      <dt>5-K/8-K/10-K</dt>

      <dt>aerobic</dt>
      <dd>Used to refer to running or other exercise at an intensity that's sufficiently easy for
        your respiratory and cardiovascular systems to deliver all or most of the oxygen required
        by your muscles, and slow enough that lactic acid doesn't appreciably build up in your
        muscles. Generally, you can sustain a slow aerobic pace for long periods of time, provided
        you have the endurance to go long distances.</dd>
