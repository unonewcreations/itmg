10-K pace

5-K/8-K/10-K
K is for kilometers, 1,000 meters. A 5-K is equal to 3.1 miles; 8-K is 4.96 miles; 10-K is equal to 6.2 miles.

400 meters
Equivalent to a quarter mile or 1 lap around a standard track.

800 meters
Equivalent to a half-mile or 2 laps around a standard track.

aerobic
Used to refer to running or other exercise at an intensity that's sufficiently easy for your respiratory and cardiovascular systems to deliver all or most of the oxygen required by your muscles, and slow enough that lactic acid doesn't appreciably build up in your muscles. Generally, you can sustain a slow aerobic pace for long periods of time, provided you have the endurance to go long distances.
